# Movie Manager

"Movie Manager" is a Java-based college project developed by **Peter P.** and **Barbora L.** using Eclipse IDE. This project is designed to provide a command line interface to manage a collection of movies. With the help of this application, users can easily add, edit, delete movies and more. The application also allows users to search for movies based on different criteria such as title or by actor names, save or load from a file and connect to a SQL database.
